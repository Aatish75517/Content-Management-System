🧾 Content Management System in Python
This is a simple Content Management System (CMS) built using core Python. It is a console-based program that allows users to create, search, update, delete, save, and load content. Each piece of content includes a Title and a Description — useful for managing how-to articles, notes, help documents, or tutorial content.

The content is stored in a Python list during runtime. Users can also save the content to a file or load it later for future use. This makes the project perfect for beginners looking to understand how data can be managed in memory and persisted using text files.
